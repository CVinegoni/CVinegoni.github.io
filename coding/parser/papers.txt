Here we show that contracting myocytes can indeed be imaged with optical microscopy at high temporal and spatial resolution in the beating murine heart, allowing visualization of individual sarcomeres and measurement of the single cardiomyocyte contractile cycle. Collectively, this has been enabled by efficient tissue stabilization, a prospective real-time cardiac gating approach, an image processing algorithm for motion-artifact-free imaging throughout the cardiac cycle, and a fluorescent membrane staining protocol. Quantification of cardiomyocyte contractile function in vivo opens many possibilities for investigating myocardial disease and therapeutic intervention at the cellular level.},

   abstract = {New imaging methods are urgently needed to identify high-risk atherosclerotic lesions prior to the onset of myocardial infarction, stroke, and ischemic limbs. Molecular imaging offers a new approach to visualize key biological features that characterize high-risk plaques associated with cardiovascular events. While substantial progress has been realized in clinical molecular imaging of plaques in larger arterial vessels (carotid, aorta, iliac), there remains a compelling, unmet need to develop molecular imaging strategies targeted to high-risk plaques in human coronary arteries. We present recent developments in intravascular near-IR fluorescence catheter-based strategies for in vivo detection of plaque inflammation in coronary-sized arteries. In particular, the biological, light transmission, imaging agent, and engineering principles that underlie a new intravascular near-IR fluorescence sensing method are discussed. Intravascular near-IR fluorescence catheters appear highly translatable to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, and thus may offer a new in vivo method to detect high-risk coronary plaques and to assess novel atherosclerosis biologics.

A transition from the monoclinic (I) gamma-phase to the triclinic delta-phase after moderate mechanical treatments has been observed for untreated powder, just what happens when the same samples are rapidly cooled to low-temperature. Evidences of the low temperature monoclinic (II) polar epsilon-phase have been found at room temperature in samples after a stronger milling treatment. The sequence of the low-temperature phase transitions appears to be strongly dependent on the mechanical history of the powders. A new low-temperature N-phase has been observed below about 200 K in different samples: it is the main phase in commercial untreated powders, having the monoclinic (I) gamma-phase at room temperature, but constitutes only a small fraction in moderately treated powders, having the triclinic delta-phase at room temperature.

An analysis of the temperature dependence of photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes assesses the relative contributions of radiative and non-radiative recombination in the centres responsible for these emissions.

Both continuous wave and time resolved measurements have been performed. The microcavity is formed by an all porous silicon Fabry-Perot filter made by two distributed Bragg reflectors separated by a lambda-thick PS cavity layer. The luminescence properties of PSM are changed with respect to those of PS: a temperature independent narrowing in the emission line shape, a different temperature dependence of the emission intensity, and a fractional shortening of the luminescence decay time over the 50-300 K temperature interval are achieved. The PSM luminescence properties are explained by the spatial redistribution of the spontaneous emission, by an effective refractive index probed by the photon mode confined in the cavity layer and by the coupling between the singlet exciton state and the photon mode confined in the cavity layer. The saturation of the absorption of the distributed Bragg reflector is also addressed. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics. [S0021-8979(99)04503-X].},

The temperature dependence of the photoluminescence decay time and the PL-integrated intensity allows a determination of radiative and nonradiative time constants of GaN. We find that luminescence peaks centered at 3.360 and 3.305 eV at low temperature can be attributed to recombination of excitons localized at extended defects. The photoluminescence radiative lifetime at room temperature is on the order of tens of ns. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics. [S0003-6951(98)00549-X].},

These studies were confirmed by immunostaining, microscopy and gene expression profiling on isolated cells. Gene expression profiling studies of cytofluorometrically sorted beta-cells from 4 and 12 week old NOD mice provided new insights into the genetic programs at play of different stages of type-1 diabetes development.

Thus, eosinophils are central effector cells during allergic airway inflammation and an important clinical therapeutic target. Here we describe the use of an injectable MMP-targeted optical sensor that specifically and quantitatively resolves eosinophil activity in the lungs of mice with experimental allergic airway inflammation. Through the use of real-time molecular imaging methods, we report the visualization of eosinophil. responses in vivo and at different scales. Eosinophil responses were seen at single-cell resolution in conducting airways using near-infrared fluorescence fiberoptic bronchoscopy, in lung parenchyma using intravital microscopy, and in the whole body using fluorescence-mediated molecular tomography. Using these real-time imaging methods, we confirmed the immunosuppressive effects of the glucocorticoid drug dexamethasone in the mouse model of allergic airway inflammation and identified a viridin-derived prodrug that potently inhibited the accumulation and enzyme activity of eosinophils in the lungs. The combination of sensitive enzyme-targeted sensors with noninvasive molecular imaging approaches permitted evaluation of airway inflammation severity and was used as a model to rapidly screen for new drug effects. Both fluorescence-mediated tomography and fiberoptic bronchoscopy techniques have the potential to be translated into the clinic.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) is common in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with high mortality. Long-term reprogramming of myeloid progenitors occurs in response to inflammatory stimuli and alters the organism's response to secondary inflammatory challenges. OBJECTIVES This study examined the effect of recurrent MI on bone marrow response and cardiac inflammation. METHODS The investigators developed a surgical mouse model in which 2 subsequent MIs affected different left ventricular regions in the same mouse. Recurrent MI was induced by ligating the left circumflex artery followed by the left anterior descending coronary artery branch. The study characterized the resulting ischemia by whole-heart fluorescent coronary angiography after optical organ clearing and by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS A first MI-induced bone marrow "memory" via a drculating signal, reducing hematopoietic maintenance factor expression in bone marrow macrophages. This dampened the organism's reaction to subsequent events. Despite a similar extent of injury according to troponin levels, recurrent MI caused reduced emergency hematopoiesis and less leukocytosis than a first MI. Consequently, fewer leukocytes migrated to the ischemic myocardium. The hematopoietic response to lipopolysaccharide was also mitigated after a previous ML The increase of white blood count in 28 patients was lower after recurrent MI compared with their first MI. CONCLUSIONS The data suggested that hematopoietic and innate immune responses are shaped by a preceding MI. (C) 2020 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

However, current approaches mostly yield static data, require lysis or rely on indirect assays and thus often provide an incomplete understanding of drug action. Here, we present a multiphoton fluorescence anisotropy microscopy live cell imaging technique to measure and map drug-target interaction in real time at subcellular resolution. This approach is generally applicable using any fluorescently labelled drug and enables high-resolution spatial and temporal mapping of bound and unbound drug distribution. To illustrate our approach we measure intracellular target engagement of the chemotherapeutic Olaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, in live cells and within a tumour in vivo. These results are the first generalizable approach to directly measure drug-target binding in vivo and present a promising tool to enhance understanding of drug activity.},

However, in two-photon microscopy, the number of fluorescent labels with distinct emission spectra that can be effectively excited and resolved is constrained by the confined tuning range of the excitation laser and the broad and overlapping nature of fluorophore two-photon absorption spectra. This limitation effectively reduces the number of available imaging channels. Here, we demonstrate that two-photon steady state anisotropy imaging (2PSSA) offers the capability to resolve otherwise unresolvable fluorescent tracers both in live cells and in mouse tumor models. This approach expands the number of biological targets that can be imaged simultaneously, increasing the total amount of information that can be obtained through imaging.

Survivors of acute coronary syndromes have a high risk of recurrent events for unknown reasons. Here we show that the systemic response to ischaemic injury aggravates chronic atherosclerosis. After myocardial infarction or stroke, Apoe(-/-) mice developed larger atherosclerotic lesions with a more advanced morphology. This disease acceleration persisted over many weeks and was associated with markedly increased monocyte recruitment. Seeking the source of surplus monocytes in plaques, we found that myocardial infarction liberated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from bone marrow niches via sympathetic nervous system signalling. The progenitors then seeded the spleen, yielding a sustained boost in monocyte production. These observations provide new mechanistic insight into atherogenesis and provide a novel therapeutic opportunity to mitigate disease progression.},

The origin of these myeloid cells, and the response of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to MI, however, is unclear. Here, we identify a CCR2(+)CD150(+)CD48(-) LSK hematopoietic subset as the most upstream contributor to emergency myelopoiesis after ischemic organ injury. This subset has 4-fold higher proliferation rates than CCR2(-)CD150(+)CD48(-) LSK cells, displays a myeloid differentiation bias, and dominates the migratory HSPC population. We further demonstrate that the myeloid translocation gene 16 (Mtg16) regulates CCR2(+) HSPC emergence. Mtg16(-/-) mice have decreased levels of systemic monocytes and infarct-associated macrophages and display compromised tissue healing and post-MI heart failure.

   abstract = {Observing drug responses in the tumor microenvironment in vivo can be technically challenging. As a result, cellular responses to molecularly targeted cancer drugs are often studied in cell culture, which does not accurately represent the behavior of cancer cells growing in vivo. Using high-resolution microscopy and fluorescently labeled genetic reporters for apoptosis, we developed an approach to visualize drug-induced cell death at single-cell resolution in vivo. Stable expression of the mitochondrial intermembrane protein IMS-RP was established in human breast and pancreatic cancer cells. Image analysis was then used to quantify release of IMS-RP into the cytoplasm upon apoptosis and irreversible mitochondrial permeabilization. Both breast and pancreatic cancer cells showed higher basal apoptotic rates in vivo than in culture. To study drug-induced apoptosis, we exposed tumor cells to navitoclax (ABT-263), an inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, both in vitro and in vivo. Although the tumors responded to Bcl-2 inhibition in vivo, inducing apoptosis in around 20% of cancer cells, the observed response was much higher in cell culture. Together, our findings show an imaging technique that can be used to directly visualize cell death within the tumor microenvironment in response to drug treatment. Cancer Res; 72(12); 2949-56.

   abstract = {Significance: Fluorescence polarization (FP) and fluorescence anisotropy (FA) microscopy are powerful imaging techniques that allow to translate the common IT assay capabilities into the in vitro and in vivo cellular domain. As a result, they have found potential for mapping drug- protein or protein-protein interactions. Unfortunately, these imaging modalities are ratiometric in nature and as such they suffer from excessive noise even under regular imaging conditions, preventing accurate image-feature analysis of fluorescent molecules behaviors. Aim: We present a high dynamic range (HDR)-based FA imaging modality for improving image quality in FA microscopy. Approach: The method exploits ad hoc acquisition schemes to extend the dynamic range of individual FP channels, allowing to obtain FA images with increased signal-to-noise ratio. Results: A direct comparison between FA images obtained with our method and the standard, clearly indicates how an HDR-based FA imaging approach allows to obtain high-quality images, with the ability to correctly resolve image features at different values of FA and over a substantially higher range of fluorescence intensities. Conclusion: The method presented is shown to outperform standard FA imaging microscopy narrowing the spread of the propagated error and yielding higher quality images. The method can be effectively and routinely used on any commercial imaging system and could be also translated to other microscopy ratiometric imaging modalities. (C) The Authors.

While exosomes have received considerable attention, much less is known about larger microvesicles. Here we profile single microvesicles (MV) and exosomes from glioblastoma (GB) cells and MV from the plasma of patients. Methods. EV secreted from mouse glioma GL261 and human primary GBM8 cell lines as well as from the plasma of 8 patients with diagnoses of GB and 2 healthy controls were isolated and processed for single vesicle analysis. EV were immobilized on glass slides and the heterogeneity of vesicle and tumor markers were analyzed at the single vesicle level. Results. We show that (i) MV are abundant, (ii) only a minority of MV expresses putative MV markers, and (iii) MV share tetraspanin biomarkers previously thought to be diagnostic of exosomes. Using MV capture and staining techniques that allow differentiation of host cell and GB-derived MV we further demonstrate that (i) tumoral MV often present as <10% of all MV in GB patient plasma, and (ii) there is extensive heterogeneity in tumor marker expression in these tumor-derived MV. Conclusion. These results indicate that single MV analysis is likely necessary to identify rare tumoral MV populations and the single vesicle analytical technique used here can be applied to both MV and exosome fractions without the need for their separation from each other. These studies form the basis for using single EV analyses for cancer diagnostics.},

Distinct structures such as tissue margins or groups of malignant cells are therefore often difficult to detect, especially under low signal-to-noise-ratio conditions. In this report, we introduce a noise suppressed multifocus image fusion algorithm, that provides detailed reconstructions even when images are acquired under sub-optimal conditions, such is the case for real time fluorescence intraoperative surgery. The algorithm makes use of the Anscombe transform combined with a multi-level stationary wavelet transform with individual threshold-based shrinkage. While the imaging system is integrated with a respiratory monitor triggering system, it can be easily adapted to any commercial imaging system. The developed algorithm is made available as a plugin for Osirix. ((c) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

   abstract = {Absorption and emission optical projection tomography (OPT), alternatively referred to as optical computed tomography (optical-CT) and optical-emission computed tomography (optical-ECT), are recently developed three-dimensional imaging techniques with value for developmental biology and ex vivo gene expression studies. The techniques' principles are similar to the ones used for x-ray computed tomography and are based on the approximation of negligible light scattering in optically cleared samples. The optical clearing is achieved by a chemical procedure which aims at substituting the cellular fluids within the sample with a cell membranes' index matching solution. Once cleared the sample presents very low scattering and is then illuminated with a light collimated beam whose intensity is captured in transillumination mode by a CCD camera. Different projection images of the sample are subsequently obtained over a 360 degrees full rotation, and a standard backprojection algorithm can be used in a similar fashion as for x-ray tomography in order to obtain absorption maps. Because not all biological samples present significant absorption contrast, it is not always possible to obtain projections with a good signal-to-noise ratio, a condition necessary to achieve high-quality tomographic reconstructions. Such is the case for example, for early stage's embryos. In this work we demonstrate how, through the use of a random noise removal algorithm, the image quality of the reconstructions can be considerably improved even when the noise is strongly present in the acquired projections. Specifically, we implemented a block matching 3D (BM3D) filter applying it separately on each acquired transillumination projection before performing a complete three-dimensional tomographical reconstruction. To test the efficiency of the adopted filtering scheme, a phantom and a real biological sample were processed. In both cases, the BM3D filter led to a signal-to-noise ratio increment of over 30 dB on severe noise-affected reconstructions revealing original-noise-hidden-image details. These results show the utility of the BM3D approach for OPT under typical conditions of very low light absorption, suggesting its implementation as an efficient alternative to other filtering schemes such as for example the median filter.},

   abstract = {Mitochondria, which are essential organelles in resting and replicating cells, can vary in number, mass and shape. Past research has primarily focused on short-term molecular mechanisms underlying fission/fusion. Less is known about longer-term mitochondrial behavior such as the overall makeup of cell populations' morphological patterns and whether these patterns can be used as biomarkers of drug response in human cells. We developed an image-based analytical technique to phenotype mitochondrial morphology in different cancers, including cancer cell lines and patient-derived cancer cells. We demonstrate that (i) cancer cells of different origins, including patient-derived xenografts, express highly diverse mitochondrial phenotypes; (ii) a given phenotype is characteristic of a cell population and fairly constant over time; (iii) mitochondrial patterns correlate with cell metabolic measurements and (iv) therapeutic interventions can alter mitochondrial phenotypes in drug-sensitive cancers as measured in pre-versus post-treatment fine needle aspirates in mice. These observations shed light on the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the biology and drug response of cancer cells. On the basis of these findings, we propose that image-based mitochondrial phenotyping can provide biomarkers for assessing cancer phenotype and drug response.},

Such structures show higher photoluminescence efficiency than reference bulk amorphous silicon nitride films. The enhancement is attributed to the localization of electron-hole Fairs induced by the multilayer structure. Fast monomolecular recombination processes are shown, with lifetimes dependent on the emission energy. Analysis of photoluminescence and absorption spectra shows a low density of defects and no intermixing at the multilayer heterointerfaces. Such features open the potential for the investigated structures to function as fast optoelectronic devices. [S0163-1829(99)13635-X].},

   abstract = {Optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed on a series of hydrogenated silicon-nitrogen thin films deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition covering a wide compositional range with the aim to find how absorption and emission processes are correlated. Our analysis indicates that the observed broadening of the PL spectra is linked with the existence of band tail states due to topological disorder, as confirmed by the spectral dependence of the PL decay. Moreover, nitrogen alloying reduces the temperature quenching of luminescence and increases the radiative recombination rate. Such phenomena are ascribed to the formation of wide tails in the density of states of N-rich samples and, in turn, to a lower carrier diffusion.},

These include estimates of the number of sensilla present on the two antennae, obtained by scanning electron microscopy, as well as electroantennography recordings of the left and right antennal responses to odorants. We describe investigative studies of the antennal lobes, where multi-photon microscopy was used to search for possible morphological asymmetries between the two brain sides. Moreover, we report on recently published results obtained by two-photon calcium imaging for functional mapping of the antennal lobe aimed at comparing patterns of activity evoked by different odours. Finally, possible links to the results of behavioural tests, measuring asymmetries in single-sided olfactory memory recall, are discussed.},

   abstract = {Due to the honey bee's importance as a simple neural model, there is a great need for new functional imaging modalities. Herein we report on the development and new finding of a combined two-photon microscope with a synchronized odor stimulus platform for in-vivo functional and morphological imaging of the honey bee's olfactory system focusing on its primary centers, the antennal lobes (ALs). Our imaging platform allows for simultaneously obtaining both morphological measurements of the AL's functional units, the glomeruli, and in-vivo calcium recording of their neural activities. By applying external odor stimuli to the bee's antennae, we were able to record the characteristic glomerular odor response maps. Compared to previous works where conventional fluorescenc microscopy was used, our approach has been demonstrated to offer all the advantages of multi-photon imaging, providing substantial enhancement in both spatial and temporal resolutions while minimizing photo-damages. In addition, compared to previous full-fiel microscopy calcium recordings, a four-fold improvement in the functional signal has been achieved. Finally, the multi-photon associated extended penetration depth allows for functional imaging of profound glomeruli. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America},

   abstract = {Exposure to psychosocial stress is a risk factor for many diseases, including atherosclerosis(1,2). Although incompletely understood, interaction between the psyche and the immune system provides one potential mechanism linking stress and disease inception and progression. Known cross-talk between the brain and immune system includes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which centrally drives glucocorticoid production in the adrenal cortex, and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis, which controls stress-induced catecholamine release in support of the fight-or-flight reflex(3,4). It remains unknown, however, whether chronic stress changes hematopoietic stem cell activity. Here we show that stress increases proliferation of these most primitive hematopoietic progenitors, giving rise to higher levels of disease-promoting inflammatory leukocytes. We found that chronic stress induced monocytosis and neutrophilia in humans. While investigating the source of leukocytosis in mice, we discovered that stress activates upstream hematopoietic stem cells. Under conditions of chronic variable stress in mice, sympathetic nerve fibers released surplus noradrenaline, which signaled bone marrow niche cells to decrease CXCL12 levels through the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor. Consequently, hematopoietic stem cell proliferation was elevated, leading to an increased output of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes. When atherosclerosis-prone Apoe(-/-) mice were subjected to chronic stress, accelerated hematopoiesis promoted plaque features associated with vulnerable lesions that cause myocardial infarction and stroke in humans.},

While bone marrow production and release of leukocyte increases after stroke, it is currently unknown whether its activity rises homogeneously throughout the entire hematopoietic system. To address this question, we employed spectrally resolved in vivo cell labeling in the murine skull and tibia. We show that in murine models of stroke and aseptic meningitis, skull bone marrow-derived neutrophils are more likely to migrate to the adjacent brain tissue than cells that reside in the tibia. Confocal microscopy of the skull-dura interface revealed myeloid cell migration through microscopic vascular channels crossing the inner skull cortex. These observations point to a direct local interaction between the brain and the skull bone marrow through the meninges.},

Here, we show that cardiac macrophages facilitate electrical conduction through the distal atrioventricular node, where conducting cells densely intersperse with elongated macrophages expressing connexin 43. When coupled to spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes via connexin-43-containing gap junctions, cardiac macrophages have a negative resting membrane potential and depolarize in synchrony with cardiomyocytes. Conversely, macrophages render the resting membrane potential of cardiomyocytes more positive and, according to computational modeling, accelerate their repolarization. Photostimulation of channelrhodopsin-2-expressing macrophages improves atrioventricular conduction, whereas conditional deletion of connexin 43 in macrophages and congenital lack of macrophages delay atrioventricular conduction. In the Cd11b(DTR) mouse, macrophage ablation induces progressive atrioventricular block. These observations implicate macrophages in normal and aberrant cardiac conduction.},

   abstract = {Macrophages populate the healthy myocardium and, depending on their phenotype, may contribute to tissue homeostasis or disease. Their origin and role in diastolic dysfunction, a hallmark of cardiac aging and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, remain unclear. Here we show that cardiac macrophages expand in humans and mice with diastolic dysfunction, which in mice was induced by either hypertension or advanced age. A higher murine myocardial macrophage density results from monocyte recruitment and increased hematopoiesis in bone marrow and spleen. In humans, we observed a parallel constellation of hematopoietic activation: circulating myeloid cells are more frequent, and splenic F-18-FDGPET/CT imaging signal correlates with echocardiographic indices of diastolic dysfunction. While diastolic dysfunction develops, cardiac macrophages produce IL-10, activate fibroblasts, and stimulate collagen deposition, leading to impaired myocardial relaxation and increased myocardial stiffness. Deletion of IL-10 in macrophages improves diastolic function. These data imply expansion and phenotypic changes of cardiac macrophages as therapeutic targets for cardiac fibrosis leading to diastolic dysfunction.},

   abstract = {Background-To enable intravascular detection of inflammation in atherosclerosis, we developed a near-infrared fluorescence ( NIRF) catheter-based strategy to sense cysteine protease activity during vascular catheterization. Methods and Results-The NIRF catheter design was based on a clinical coronary artery guidewire. In phantom studies of NIRF plaques, blood produced only a mild (<30%) attenuation of the fluorescence signal compared with saline, affirming the favorable optical properties of the NIR window. Catheter evaluation in vivo used atherosclerotic rabbits (n=11). Rabbits received an injection of a cysteine protease-activatable NIRF imaging agent (Prosense750; excitation/emission, 750/770 nm) or saline. Catheter pullbacks through the blood-filled iliac artery detected NIRF signals 24 hours after injection of the probe. In the protease agent group, the in vivo peak plaque target-to-background ratio was 558% greater than controls (6.8 +/- 1.9 versus 1.3 +/- 0.3, mean +/- SEM; P<0.05). Ex vivo fluorescence reflectance imaging corroborated these results (target-to-background ratio, 10.3 +/- 1.8 for agent versus 1.8 +/- 0.3 for saline group; P<0.01). In the protease group only, saline flush-modulated NIRF signal profiles further distinguished atheromata from normal segments in vivo (P<0.01). Good correlation between the in vivo and ex vivo plaque target-to-background ratio was present (r=0.82, P<0.01). Histopathological analyses demonstrated strong NIRF signal in plaques only from the protease agent group. NIRF signals colocalized with immunoreactive macrophages and the cysteine protease cathepsin B. Conclusions-An intravascular fluorescence catheter can detect cysteine protease activity in vessels the size of human coronary arteries in real time with an activatable NIRF agent. This strategy could aid in the detection of inflammation and high-risk plaques in small arteries. (Circulation. 2008; 118: 1802-1809.)},

Here we introduce scission-accelerated fluorophore exchange (SAFE), a method for multiplexed temporospatial imaging of living cells with immunofluorescence. SAFE uses a rapid bioorthogonal click chemistry to remove immunofluorescent signals from the surface of labeled cells, cycling the nanomolar-concentration reagents in seconds and enabling multiple rounds of staining of the same samples. It is non-toxic and functional in both dispersed cells and intact living tissues. We demonstrate multiparameter (n >= 14), non-disruptive imaging of murine peripheral blood mononuclear and bone marrow cells to profile cellular differentiation. We also show longitudinal multiplexed imaging of bone marrow progenitor cells as they develop into neutrophils over 6 days and real-time multiplexed cycling of living mouse hepatic tissues. We anticipate that SAFE will find broad utility for investigating physiologic dynamics in living systems. Live cells and tissues are imaged over long time periods using a fast, non-toxic click chemistry.},

It was found that a grinding of pure WO3 leads to a decrease of the crystallites size and a development of the bluish coloration. The color change was found to be reversible under moderate heat treatment or after storage in oxidizing atmosphere and is attributed to the reduced W5+ ions, located at the surface of freshly ground powder. The (1-x) WO3-y. xReO(2) mixtures were found to be composed of monoclinic/orthorhombic WO3 and orthorhombic ReO2 phases with a grain boundary containing reduced W5.7+ ions which are mainly responsible for the compound color at low rhenium ion concentrations. In both cases, the W(6-z+) (0<z less than or equal to 1) color centers are responsible for strong optical absorption resulting in the dramatic decrease of the total Raman intensity. The structural models of free surface in pure ground WO3 and bulk WO3/ReO2 intragrain boundary in (1-x) WO3-y. xReO(2) mixtures are proposed and discussed. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics.

These compartments often are inaccessible for controlled and rapid experimentation, thus limiting studies to the evaluation of conventional cell culture and transgenic animal models. Here we describe the manufacture and image-guided monitoring of an engineered microenvironment with user-defined properties that recruits hematopoietic progenitors into the implant. Using intravital imaging and fluorescence molecular tomography, we show in real time that the cell homing and retention process is efficient and durable for short-and long-term engraftment studies. Our results indicate that bone marrow stromal cells, precoated on the implant, accelerate the formation of new sinusoidal blood vessels with vascular integrity at the micro-capillary level that enhances the recruitment hematopoietic progenitor cells to the site. This implantable construct can serve as a tool enabling the study of hematopoiesis.},

   abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to explore post-myocardial infarction (MI) myocardial inflammation. Background Innate immune cells are centrally involved in infarct healing and are emerging therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease; however, clinical tools to assess their presence in tissue are scarce. Furthermore, it is currently not known if the nonischemic remote zone recruits monocytes. Methods Acute inflammation was followed in mice with coronary ligation by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)FDG) positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, polymerase chain reaction, and histology. Results Gd-DTPA-enhanced infarcts showed high (18)FDG uptake on day 5 after MI. Cell depletion and isolation data confirmed that this largely reflected inflammation; CD11b(+) cells had 4-fold higher (18)FDG uptake than the infarct tissue from which they were isolated (p < 0.01). Surprisingly, there was considerable monocyte recruitment in the remote myocardium (approximately 10(4)/mg of myocardium, 5.6-fold increase; p < 0.01), a finding mirrored by macrophage infiltration in the remote myocardium of patients with acute MI. Temporal kinetics of cell recruitment were slower than in the infarct, with peak numbers on day 10 after ischemia. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed a robust increase of recruiting adhesion molecules and chemokines in the remote myocardium (e.g., 12-fold increase of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), although levels were always lower than in the infarct. Finally, matrix metalloproteinase activity was significantly increased in noninfarcted myocardium, suggesting that monocyte recruitment to the remote zone may contribute to post-MI dilation. Conclusions This study shed light on the innate inflammatory response in remote myocardium after MI. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2012; 59: 153-63) (C) 2012 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation},

   abstract = {A major challenge in high-resolution intravital confocal and multiphoton microscopy is physiologic tissue movement during image acquisition. Of the various physiological sources of movement, respiration has arguably the largest and most wide-ranging effect. We describe a technique for achieving stabilized microscopy imaging using a dual strategy. First, we designed a mechanical stabilizer for constraining physical motion; this served to simultaneously increase the in-focus range over which data can be acquired as well as increase the reproducibility of imaging a certain position within each confocal imaging plane. Second, by implementing a retrospective breathing-gated imaging modality, we performed selective image extraction gated to a particular phase of the respiratory cycle. Thanks to the high reproducibility in position, all gated images presented a high degree of correlation over time. The images obtained using this technique not only showed significant improvements over images acquired without the stabilizer, but also demonstrated accurate in vivo imaging during longitudinal studies. The described methodology is easy to implement with any commercial imaging system, as are used by most biological imaging laboratories, and can be used for both confocal and multiphoton laser scanning microscopy. c 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

   abstract = {Intravital fluorescence microscopy, through extended penetration depth and imaging resolution, provides the ability to image at cellular and subcellular resolution in live animals, presenting an opportunity for new insights into in vivo biology. Unfortunately, physiological induced motion components due to respiration and cardiac activity are major sources of image artifacts and impose severe limitations on the effective imaging resolution that can be ultimately achieved in vivo. Here we present a novel imaging methodology capable of automatically removing motion artifacts during intravital microscopy imaging of organs and orthotopic tumors. The method is universally applicable to different laser scanning modalities including confocal and multiphoton microscopy, and offers artifact free reconstructions independent of the physiological motion source and imaged organ. The methodology, which is based on raw data acquisition followed by image processing, is here demonstrated for both cardiac and respiratory motion compensation in mice heart, kidney, liver, pancreas and dorsal window chamber.},

   abstract = {The precipitation of germanium nanocrystals in amorphous carbon-germanium films allows for the development of innovative devices, but the accurate control of both size and size distribution of Ge quantum dots in these matrices still constitutes a challenging step. In this paper, both the structure and morphology of amorphous carbon-germanium films (a-Ge1-xCx), deposited by d.c. magnetron sputtering onto silicon substrates and annealed in vacuum at temperatures up to 550 degrees C, are investigated by Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The main features of Raman spectra obtained from carbon-rich films (x > 0.43) are the D and G bands, characteristic of graphitic carbon films. The ratio between the intensities of the bands, I-D/I-G, increases with the annealing temperature, suggesting a progressive increase of the graphitic domains within the films. Raman spectra obtained in the low frequency region from both as-deposited and annealed germanium-rich films (x < 0.43) show broad bands associated with transverse acoustic and transverse optic Ge-Ge modes. Cre-Ge optic modes merge up into a well-shaped peak at 300 cm(-1) in the germanium-richest sample, and underwent annealing treatment at 550 degrees C, thus indicating the precipitation of crystalline Ge. Scanning electron microscopy analysis shows an apparently uniform nucleation of Ge crystallites at the sample surface. Microprobe Raman scattering results suggest the formation of a nearly homogeneous distribution of Ge nanocrystals in germanium-rich films annealed at 550 degrees C. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

We present a method of nonlinear interferometry to differentiate between which components of the anti-Stokes signal are resonant and nonresonant. The technique takes advantage of the persistence of intermediate states involved in the resonant process. This method is applicable to most existing pulsed CARS illumination methods and provides for identification of resonant CARS. We demonstrate the method by examining the signals produced by acetone, which exhibits resonance, and water, which does not. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

The technique uses optical frequency radiation, which is relatively easy to create, manipulate and detect.
Unfortunately, the Raman effect is rather weak: Typically only one in a million photons is converted to the detected Raman radiation, so it is too slow to be used as a clinical diagnostic tool or to monitor fast biological processes. Using pulsed laser illumination, Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) can stimulate the production of many
more Raman photons by simultaneously exciting the molecular vibrations and detecting the emitted stimulated Raman scattering.},

The influence of glial cells on the accumulation and clearance of beta-amyloid (A beta) and neurofibrillary tau in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is poorly understood, despite growing awareness that these are therapeutically important interactions(4,5). Here we show, in humans and mice, that astrocyte-sourced interleukin-3 (IL-3) programs microglia to ameliorate the pathology of AD. Upon recognition of A beta deposits, microglia increase their expression of IL-3R alpha-the specific receptor for IL-3 (also known as CD123)-making them responsive to IL-3. Astrocytes constitutively produce IL-3, which elicits transcriptional, morphological, and functional programming of microglia to endow them with an acute immune response program, enhanced motility, and the capacity to cluster and clear aggregates of A beta and tau. These changes restrict AD pathology and cognitive decline. Our findings identify IL-3 as a key mediator of astrocyte-microglia cross-talk and a node for therapeutic intervention in AD.},

To address the need for same-day diagnosis, we developed an automated image cytometry system (CytoPAN) that allows rapid breast cancer diagnosis of scant cellular specimens obtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA) of palpable mass lesions. The system is devoid of moving parts for stable operations, harnesses optimized antibody kits for multiplexed analysis, and offers a user-friendly interface with automated analysis for rapid diagnoses. Through extensive optimization and validation using cell lines and mouse models, we established breast cancer diagnosis and receptor subtyping in 1 hour using as few as 50 harvested cells. In a prospective patient cohort study (n = 68), we showed that the diagnostic accuracy was 100% for cancer detection and the receptor subtyping accuracy was 96% for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and 93% for hormonal receptors (ER/PR), two key biomarkers associated with breast cancer. A combination of FNA and CytoPAN offers faster, less invasive cancer diagnoses than the current standard (core biopsy and histopathology). This approach should enable the ability to more rapidly diagnose breast cancer in global and remote settings.},

Using biocompatible nanoparticles as a generic platform (containing a F-18 isotope and a far red fluorochrome), we show good correlations between FMT and PET in probe concentration (r(2) > 0.99) and spatial signal distribution (r(2) > 0.85). Using a mouse model of cancer and different imaging probes to measure tumoral proteases, macrophage content and integrin expression simultaneously, we demonstrate the distinct tumoral locations of probes in multiple channels in vivo. The findings also suggest that FMT can serve as a surrogate modality for the screening and development of radionuclide-based imaging agents.},

   abstract = {Interactions between the immune and central nervous systems strongly influence brain health. Although the blood-brain barrier restricts this crosstalk, we now know that meningeal gateways through brain border tissues facilitate intersystem communication. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which interfaces with the glymphatic system and thereby drains the brain's interstitial and perivascular spaces, facilitates outward signaling beyond the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, we report that CSF can exit into the skull bone marrow. Fluorescent tracers injected into the cisterna magna of mice migrate along perivascular spaces of dural blood vessels and then travel through hundreds of sub-millimeter skull channels into the calvarial marrow. During meningitis, bacteria hijack this route to invade the skull's hematopoietic niches and initiate cranial hematopoiesis ahead of remote tibial sites. As skull channels also directly provide leukocytes to meninges, the privileged sampling of brain-derived danger signals in CSF by regional marrow may have broad implications for inflammatory neurological disorders. This manuscript describes a new cerebral spinal fluid exit route via hundreds of skull channels, with the cranial bone marrow as a destination. In meningitis, bacteria hijack this path and alert hematopoietic stem cells residing in the skull marrow.},

   abstract = {For centuries, biological discoveries were based on optical imaging, in particular microscopy but also several chromophoric assays and photographic approaches. With the recent emergence of methods appropriate for bio-marker in vivo staining, such as bioluminescence, fluorescent molecular probes and proteins, as well as nanoparticle-based targeted agents, significant attention has been shifted toward in vivo interrogations of different dynamic biological processes at the molecular level. This progress has been largely supported by the development of advanced tomographic imaging technologies suitable for obtaining volumetric visualization of bio-marker distributions in small animals at a whole-body or whole-organ scale, an imaging frontier that is not accessible by the existing tissue-sectioning microscopic techniques due to intensive light scattering beyond the depth of a few hundred microns. Major examples of such recently developed optical imaging modalities are reviewed here, including bioluminescence tomography (BLT), fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), and optical projection tomography (OPT). The pharmaceutical imaging community has quickly appropriated itself of these novel forms of optical imaging, since they come with very compelling advantages, such as quantitative three-dimensional capabilities, direct correlation to the biological cultures, easiness and cost-effectiveness of use, and the use of safe non-ionizing radiation. Some multi-modality approaches, combining light with other imaging modalities such as X-Ray CT or MRI, giving the ability to acquire both an optical contrast reconstruction along with a hi-fidelity anatomical images, are also reviewed. A separate section is devoted to the hybrid imaging techniques based on the optoacoustic phenomenon, such as multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), which are poised to leverage the traditional contrast and specificity advantages of optical spectrum by delivering an ever powerful set of capabilities, including real-time operation and high spatial resolution, not affected by the scattering nature of biological tissues.},

We describe a multispectral opto-acoustic tomography technique capable of high-resolution visualization of fluorescent proteins deep within highly light-scattering living organisms. The method uses multiwavelength illumination over multiple projections combined with selective-plane opto-acoustic detection for artifact-free data collection. Accurate image reconstruction is enabled by making use of wavelength-dependent light propagation models in tissue. By performing whole-body imaging of two biologically important and optically diffuse model organisms, Drosophila melanogaster pupae and adult zebrafish, we demonstrate the facility to resolve tissue-specific expression of eGFP and mCherrry fluorescent proteins for precise morphological and functional observations in vivo.},

Therefore, imaging of many important model organisms, such as insects, fishes, worms and similarly sized biological specimens, is currently limited to embryonic or other transparent stages of development. This makes it difficult to relate embryonic cellular and molecular mechanisms to consequences in organ function and animal behavior in more advanced stages and adults. Herein, we have developed a selective-plane illumination optoacoustic tomography technique for in vivo imaging of optically diffusive organisms and tissues. The method is capable of whole-body imaging at depths from the sub-millimeter up to centimeter range with a scalable spatial resolution in the order of magnitude of a few tenths of microns. In contrast to pure optical methods, the spatial resolution here is not determined nor limited by light diffusion; therefore, such performance cannot be achieved by any other optical imaging technology developed so far. The utility of the method is demonstrated on several whole-body models and small-animal extremities.},

Determining the distribution and target inhibitory activity of these drugs in individual subjects, however, has proven problematic. Here, we used a PARP agent for positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging (F-18-BO), which we developed based on the Olaparib scaffold using rapid bioorthogonal conjugation chemistries. We show that the bioorthogonal F-18 modification of the parent molecule is simple, highly efficient, and well tolerated, resulting in a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 17.9 +/- 1.1 nM. Intravital imaging showed ubiquitous distribution of the drug and uptake into cancer cells, with ultimate localization within the nucleus, all of which were inhibitable. Whole-body PET-CT imaging showed tumoral uptake of the drug, which decreased significantly, after a daily dose of Olaparib. Standard F-18-fludeoxyglucose imaging, however, failed to detect such therapy-induced changes. This research represents a step toward developing a more generic approach for the rapid codevelopment of companion imaging agents based on small-molecule therapeutic inhibitors.},

   abstract = {The hallmark of type 1 diabetes is autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells of the pancreatic islets. Autoimmune diabetes has been difficult to study or treat because it is not usually diagnosed until substantial beta-cell loss has already occurred. Imaging agents that permit noninvasive visualization of changes in beta-cell mass remain a high-priority goal. We report on the development and testing of a near-infrared fluorescent beta-cell imaging agent. Based on the amino acid sequence of exendin-4, we created a neopeptide via introduction of an unnatural amino acid at the K(12) position, which could subsequently be conjugated to fluorophores via bioorthogonal copper-catalyzed click-chemistry. Cell assays confirmed that the resulting fluorescent probe (E4(x12)-VT750) had a high binding affinity (similar to 3 nM). Its in vivo properties were evaluated using high-resolution intravital imaging, histology, whole-pancreas visualization, and endoscopic imaging. According to intravital microscopy, the probe rapidly bound to beta-cells and, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy, it was internalized. Histology of the whole pancreas showed a close correspondence between fluorescence and insulin staining, and there was an excellent correlation between imaging signals and beta-cell mass in mice treated with streptozotocin, a beta-cell toxin. Individual islets could also be visualized by endoscopic imaging. In short, E4(x12)-VT750 showed strong and selective binding to glucose-like peptide-1 receptors and permitted accurate measurement of beta-cell mass in both diabetic and nondiabetic mice. This near-infrared imaging probe, as well as future radioisotope-labeled versions of it, should prove to be important tools for monitoring diabetes, progression, and treatment in both experimental and clinical contexts.},

A strong lateralization favouring the right antenna was discovered in odour learning and short-term memory recall experiments, and a lateral shift favouring the left antenna for long-term memory recall. Corresponding morphological asymmetries have been found in the distribution of olfactory sensilla between the antennae and confirmed by electrophysiological odour response measurements in isolated right and left antennae. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a morphological asymmetry can be observed in the volume of the primary olfactory centres of the central nervous system, the antennal lobes (ALs). Precise volume measurements of a subset of their functional units, the glomeruli, were performed in both sides of the brain, exploiting the advantages of two-photon microscopy. This novel method allowed minimal invasive acquisition of volume images of the ALs, avoiding artefacts from brain extraction and dehydration. The study was completed by a series of behavioural experiments in which response asymmetry in odour recall following proboscis extension reflex conditioning was assessed for odours, chosen to stimulate strong activity in the same glomeruli as in the morphological study. The volumetric measurements found no evidence of lateralization in the investigated glomeruli within the experimental limits. Instead, in the behavioural experiments, a striking odour dependence of the lateralization was observed. The results are discussed on the basis of recent neurophysiological and ethological experiments in A. mellifera. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.},

The bone marrow niche regulates hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and hence the systemic leukocyte pool, but whether cardiovascular disease affects the hematopoietic organ’s microvasculature is unknown. Here we show that hypertension, atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction (MI) instigate endothelial dysfunction, leakage, vascular fibrosis and angiogenesis in the bone marrow, altogether leading to overproduction of inflammatory myeloid cells and systemic leukocytosis. Limiting angiogenesis with endothelial deletion of Vegfr2 (encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2) curbed emergency hematopoiesis after MI. We noted that bone marrow endothelial cells assumed inflammatory transcriptional phenotypes in all examined stages of cardiovascular disease. Endothelial deletion of Il6 or Vcan (encoding versican), genes shown to be highly expressed in mice with atherosclerosis or MI, reduced hematopoiesis and systemic myeloid cell numbers in these conditions. Our findings establish that cardiovascular disease remodels the vascular bone marrow niche, stimulating hematopoiesis and production of inflammatory leukocytes.},

   abstract = {Epithelial cells are generally considered to be static relative to their neighbours. Basal cells in pseudostratified epithelia display a single long cytoplasmic process that can cross the tight junction barrier to reach the lumen. Using in vivo microscopy to visualize the epididymis, a model system for the study of pseudostratified epithelia, we report here the surprising discovery that these basal cell projections-which we call axiopodia-periodically extend and retract over time. We found that axiopodia extensions and retractions follow an oscillatory pattern. This movement, which we refer to as periodic axial motility (PAM), is controlled by c-Src and MEK1/2-ERK1/2. Therapeutic inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity induces a retraction of these projections. Such unexpected cell motility may reflect a novel mechanism by which specialized epithelial cells sample the luminal environment.},

We show that, in ApoE(-/-) mice with coronary ligation, increased sympathetic tone up-regulates not only hematopoietic leukocyte production but also plaque endothelial expression of adhesion molecules. To counteract the resulting arterial leukocyte recruitment, we developed nanoparticle-based RNA interference (RNAi) that effectively silences five key adhesion molecules. Simultaneously encapsulating small interfering RNA (siRNA)-targeting intercellular cell adhesion molecules 1 and 2 (Icam1 and Icam2), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (Vcam1), and E-and P-selectins (Sele and Selp) into polymeric endothelial-avid nanoparticles reduced post-MI neutrophil and monocyte recruitment into atherosclerotic lesions and decreased matrix-degrading plaque protease activity. Five-gene combination RNAi also curtailed leukocyte recruitment to ischemic myocardium. Therefore, targeted multigene silencing may prevent complications after acute MI.},

Specifically, we demonstrated a 15 nm thick Au nanomesh electrode with 8.14 Omega.cm(2) normalized impedance, >65% average transmittance over a 300-1100 nm window, and stability up to 300 bending cycles. Systematic sheet resistance measurements, electrochemical impedance studies, optical characterization, mechanical bending tests, and cell studies highlight the capabilities of the Au nanomesh as a transparent electrophysiology electrode and interconnect material. Together, these results demonstrate applicability of using nanomesh under biological conditions and broad applications in biology and medicine.},

This microscopic technique allows for the simultaneous acquisition of optical coherence microscopy and multiphoton microscopy data with particular emphasis for applications in cell biology and tissue engineering. The capability of this technique is shown using representative 3D cell and tissue engineering cultures consisting of primary fibroblasts from transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice and GFP-vinculin transfected fibroblasts.

   abstract = {Rationale: Inflammatory stress induced by exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide causes hematopoietic stem cell expansion in the bone marrow niche, generating a cellular immune response. As an integral component of the hematopoietic stem cell niche, the bone marrow vasculature regulates the production and release of blood leukocytes, which protect the host against infection but also fuel inflammatory diseases. Objective: We aimed to develop imaging tools to explore vascular changes in the bone marrow niche during acute inflammation. Methods and Results: Using the TLR (Toll-like receptor) ligand lipopolysaccharide as a prototypical danger signal, we applied multiparametric, multimodality and multiscale imaging to characterize how the bone marrow vasculature adapts when hematopoiesis boosts leukocyte supply. In response to lipopolysaccharide, ex vivo flow cytometry and histology showed vascular changes to the bone marrow niche. Specifically, proliferating endothelial cells gave rise to new vasculature in the bone marrow during hypoxic conditions. We studied these vascular changes with complementary intravital microscopy and positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging. Fluorescence and positron emission tomography integrin alpha V beta 3 imaging signal increased during lipopolysaccharide-induced vascular remodeling. Vascular leakiness, quantified by albumin-based in vivo microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging, rose when neutrophils departed and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells proliferated more vigorously. Conclusions: Introducing a tool set to image bone marrow either with cellular resolution or noninvasively within the entire skeleton, this work sheds light on angiogenic responses that accompany emergency hematopoiesis. Understanding and monitoring bone marrow vasculature may provide a key to unlock therapeutic targets regulating systemic inflammation.},

   abstract = {The bioactive plant diterpene oridonin displays important pharmacological activities and is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine; however, its molecular mechanism of action is still incompletely described. In vitro and in vivo data have demonstrated anti-tumor activity of oridonin and its ability to interfere with several cell pathways; however, presently only the molecular chaperone HSP70 has been identified as a direct potential target of this compound. Here, using a combination of different proteomic approaches, innovative Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) experiments, and classical biochemical methods, we demonstrate that oridonin interacts with Nucleolin, effectively modulating the activity of this multifunctional protein. The ability of oridonin to target Nucleolin and/or HSP70 could account for the bioactivity profile of this plant diterpene. Recently, Nucleolin has attracted attention as a druggable target, as its diverse functions are implicated in pathological processes such as cancer, inflammation, and viral infection. However, up to now, no small molecule as Nucleolin binders has been reported, thus our finding represents the first evidence of Nucleolin modulation by a small inhibitor.},

   abstract = {New high-resolution molecular and structural imaging strategies are needed to visualize high-risk plaques that are likely to cause acute myocardial infarction, because current diagnostic methods do not reliably identify at-risk subjects. Although molecular imaging agents are available for low-resolution detection of atherosclerosis in large arteries, a lack of imaging agents coupled to high-resolution modalities has limited molecular imaging of atherosclerosis in the smaller coronary arteries. Here, we have demonstrated that indocyanine green (ICG), a Food and Drug Administration-approved near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)-emitting compound, targets atheromas within 20 min of injection and provides sufficient signal enhancement for in vivo detection of lipid-rich, inflamed, coronary-sized plaques in atherosclerotic rabbits. In vivo NIRF sensing was achieved with an intravascular wire in the aorta, a vessel of comparable caliber to human coronary arteries. Ex vivo fluorescence reflectance imaging showed high plaque target-to-background ratios in atheroma-bearing rabbits injected with ICG compared to atheroma-bearing rabbits injected with saline. In vitro studies using human macrophages established that ICG preferentially targets lipid-loaded macrophages. In an early clinical study of human atheroma specimens from four patients, we found that ICG colocalized with plaque macrophages and lipids. The atheroma-targeting capability of ICG has the potential to accelerate the clinical development of NIRF molecular imaging of high-risk plaques in humans.},

XRD reveals that the structure of the GaN layer is predominantly wurtzite. AFM images reveal that all the deposited layers have a relatively smooth surface, while RS confirmed the predominant presence of hexagonal GaN with a high polycrystalline character. Analysis of the results obtained for samples grown under different conditions, such as the substrate temperatures in the growth chamber as well as different substrates used, helps to define better the experimental conditions of the growth process of PLD-GaN films.

These processes are often difficult to measure in vivo due to their complexities and occurrence within single cells. It has been particularly difficult to directly measure cellular drug target binding. Fluorescence polarization is commonly used in pharmacological screening assays to measure drug-protein or protein-protein interactions. We hypothesized that fluorescence polarization imaging could be adapted and used with fluorescently labeled drugs to measure drug target engagement in vivo. Here, we summarize recent results using two photon fluorescence anisotropy microscopy. Our imaging technique offers quantitative pharmacological binding information of diverse molecular interactions at themicroscopic level, differentiating between bound, and unbound states. Used in combination with other recent advances in the development of novel fluorescently labeled drugs, we expect that the described imaging modality will provide a window into the distribution and efficacy of drugs in real time and in vivo at the cellular and subcellular level.},

However, the limited dynamic range of current photodetectors and imaging charge-coupled devices impose a limit on the fluorescence intensities that can be simultaneously captured during a single image acquisition. This is particularly troublesome when imaging biological samples, where protein expression fluctuates considerably. As a result, biological images will often contain regions with signal that is either saturated or hidden within background noise, causing information loss. In this paper, we summarize recent work from our group and others, to extended conventional to high dynamic range fluorescence imaging. These strategies have many biological applications, such as mapping of neural connections, vascular imaging, biodistribution studies or pharmacologic imaging at the single cell and organ level.},

Such methods would thus have far-reaching applications in drug development and molecular pharmacology. We recently presented one such technique based on fluorescence anisotropy, a spectroscopic method based on polarization light analysis and capable of measuring the binding interaction between molecules. Our technique allows the direct characterization of target engagement of fluorescently labeled drugs, using fluorophores with a fluorescence lifetime larger than the rotational correlation of the bound complex. Here we describe an optimized protocol for simultaneous dual-channel two-photon fluorescence anisotropy microscopy acquisition to perform drug-target measurements. We also provide the necessary software to implement stream processing to visualize images and to calculate quantitative parameters. The assembly and characterization part of the protocol can be implemented in 1 d. Sample preparation, characterization and imaging of drug binding can be completed in 2 d. Although currently adapted to an Olympus FV1000MPEPE microscope, the protocol can be extended to other commercial or custom-built microscopes.},

In this Letter we demonstrate its capability to tomographically visualize molecular activity in whole organs of mice. In particular, eosinophil activity in asthmatic lungs is resolved using a Born-normalized fluorescence optical projection tomography and employing a near-IR molecular probe.

The distribution is studied both via numerical simulations and with analytical theory and very good agreement is found between the two. In addition, we have experimentally obtained the probability density distribution for the PDL and, even in this case, we find good agreement with the predicted one. The mean accumulated PDL is found to grow linearly with the number of circulations N in contraposition to a straight-line system. Moreover, the statistical distribution tends to become uniformly distributed as N is increasing. Finally, the statistics of the PDL for a recirculating loop, when considering small values of PDL, is found to be equal to the statistics of the differential group delay for recirculating loops.},

The technique renders biological sample optically transparent by first dehydrating them and then placing in a mixture of benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate in a 2:1 ratio (BABB or Murray s Clear solution). The technique renders biological samples optically transparent by first dehydrating them in graded ethanol solutions then placing them in a mixture of benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate in a 2:1 ratio (BABB or Murray s Clear solution) to clear. After the clearing process the scattering contribution in the sample can be greatly reduced and made almost negligible while the absorption contribution cannot be eliminated completely. When trying to reconstruct the fluorescence distribution within the sample under investigation, this contribution affects the reconstructions and leads, inevitably, to image artifacts and quantification errors.. While absorption could be reduced further with a permanence of weeks or months in the clearing media, this will lead to progressive loss of fluorescence and to an unrealistically long sample processing time. This is true when reconstructing both exogenous contrast agents (molecular contrast agents) as well as endogenous contrast (e.g. reconstructions of genetically expressed fluorescent proteins).},

   abstract = {Visualizing developing organ formation as well as progession and treatment of disease often heavily relies on the ability to optically interrogate molecular and functional changes in intact living organisms. Most existing optical imaging methods are inadequate for imaging at dimensions that lie between the penetration limits of modern optical microscopy (0.5-1mm) and the diffusion-imposed limits of optical macroscopy (>1cm) [1]. Thus, many important model organisms, e.g. insects, animal embryos or small animal extremities, remain inaccessible for in-vivo optical imaging. Although there is increasing interest towards the development of nanometer-resolution optical imaging methods, there have not been many successful efforts in improving the imaging penetration depth. The ability to perform in-vivo imaging beyond microscopy limits is in fact met with the difficulties associated with photon scattering present in tissues. Recent efforts to image entire embryos for example [2,3] require special chemical treatment of the specimen, to clear them from scattering, a procedure that makes them suitable only for post-mortem imaging. These methods however evidence the need for imaging larger specimens than the ones usually allowed by two-photon or confocal microscopy, especially in developmental biology and in drug discovery. We have developed a new optical imaging technique named Mesoscopic Fluorescence Tomography [4], which appropriate for non-invasive in-vivo imaging at dimensions of 1mm-5mm. The method exchanges resolution for penetration depth, but offers unprecedented tomographic imaging performance and it has been developed to add time as a new dimension in developmental biology observations (and possibly other areas of biological research) by imparting the ability to image the evolution of fluorescence-tagged responses over time. As such it can accelerate studies of morphological or functional dependencies on gene mutations or external stimuli, and can importantly, capture the complete picture of development or tissue function by allowing longitudinal time-lapse visualization of the same, developing organism. The technique utilizes a modified laboratory microscope and multi-projection illumination to collect data at 360-degree projections. It applies the Fermi simplification to Fokker-Plank solution of the photon transport equation, combined with geometrical optics principles in order to build a realistic inversion scheme suitable for mesoscopic range. This allows in-vivo whole-body visualization of non-transparent three-dimensional structures in samples up to several millimeters in size. We have demonstrated the in-vivo performance of the technique by imaging three-dimensional structures of developing Drosophila tissues in-vivo and by following the morphogenesis of the wings in the opaque Drosophila pupae in real time over six consecutive hours.},

It allows us to model straightforwardly go-and-return paths as in interferometers with standard or Faraday mirrors. In the experiment all the fluctuations in the linear birefringence, including temperature- and pressure-induced ones, are successfully removed in a passive way by using a double pass of the fibre under test with a Faraday mirror at the end of the fibre. This allows us to use long fibres and relatively low input powers. The match between the experimental data and our model is excellent, except at higher intensities where deviations due to modulation instability start to appear.},

Motion of the tissue from the cardiac and respiratory cycles severely limits intravital microscopy by compromising ultimate spatial and temporal imaging resolution. However, significant recent advances have enabled single-cell resolution imaging to be achieved in vivo. In this protocol, we describe experimental procedures for intravital microscopy based on a combination of thoracic surgery, tissue stabilizers and acquisition gating methods, which enable imaging at the single-cell level in the beating heart in the mouse. Setup of the model is typically completed in 1 h, which allows 2 h or more of continuous cardiac imaging. This protocol can be readily adapted for the imaging of other moving organs, and it will therefore broadly facilitate in vivo high-resolution microscopy studies.},

   abstract = {To date there is a lack of tools to map the spatio-temporal dynamics of diverse cells in experimental heart models. Conventional histology is labor intensive with limited coverage, whereas many imaging techniques do not have sufficiently high enough spatial resolution to map cell distributions. We have designed and built a high resolution, dual channel Born-normalized near-infrared fluorescence optical projection tomography system to quantitatively and spatially resolve molecular agents distribution within whole murine heart. We validated the use of the system in a mouse model of monocytes/macrophages recruitment during myocardial infarction. While acquired, data were processed and reconstructed in real time. Tomographic analysis and visualization of the key inflammatory components were obtained via a mathematical formalism based on left ventricular modeling. We observed extensive monocyte recruitment within and around the infarcted areas and discovered that monocytes were also extensively recruited into non-ischemic myocardium, beyond that of injured tissue, such as the septum.},

   abstract = {Intravital imaging microscopy (i.e., imaging in live animals at microscopic resolution) has become an indispensable tool for studying the cellular micro-dynamics in cancer, immunology and neurobiology. High spatial and temporal resolution, combined with large penetration depth and multi-reporter visualization capability make fluorescence intravital microscopy compelling for heart imaging. However, tissue motion caused by cardiac contraction and respiration critically limits its use. As a result, in vitro cell preparations or non-contracting explanted heart models are more commonly employed. Unfortunately, these approaches fall short of understanding the more complex host physiology that may be dynamic and occur over longer periods of time. In this review, we report on novel technologies, which have been recently developed by our group and others, aimed at overcoming motion-induced artifacts and capable of providing in vivo subcellular resolution imaging in the beating mouse heart. The methods are based on mechanical stabilization, image processing algorithms, gated/triggered acquisition schemes or a combination of both. We expect that in the immediate future all these methodologies will have considerable applications in expanding our understanding of the cardiac biology, elucidating cardiomyocyte function and interactions within the organism in vivo, and ultimately improving the treatment of cardiac diseases.},

Highly successful motion compensation techniques have been developed for clinical imaging (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging) but the use of more advanced techniques for intravital microscopy is largely unexplored. Here, we implement a sequential cardiorespiratory gating scheme (SCG) for averaged microscopy. We show that SCG is very efficient in eliminating motion artifacts, is highly practical, enables high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in vivo imaging, and yields large field of views. The technique is particularly useful for high-speed data acquisition or for imaging scenarios where the fluorescence signal is not significantly above noise or background levels.

Technical advancements in imaging techniques and hardware components, combined with the development of novel targeted probes and new mice models, have enabled us to address long-standing questions in several biology areas such as oncology, cell biology, immunology, and neuroscience. As the instrument resolution has increased, physiological motion activities have become a major obstacle that prevents imaging live animals at resolutions analogue to the ones obtained in vitro. Motion compensation techniques aim at reducing this gap and can effectively increase the in vivo resolution. This paper provides a technical review of some of the latest developments in motion compensation methods, providing organ specific solutions.},

motion excursions and can be used in conjunction with both prospective or retrospective gating approaches. We show
that the new approach offers cellular resolution in the beating murine heart without perturbing normal physiology.
In addition, because this technique allows multiple areas to be easily probed, it offers the opportunity for wide area
coverage at high resolution.},

   abstract = {The spectroscopic content within optical coherence tomography (OCT) data can provide a wealth of information. Spectroscopic OCT methods are frequently limited by time-frequency trade-offs that limit high spectral and spatial resolution simultaneously. We present spectroscopic spectral-domain optical coherence microscopy performed with a multimodality microscope. Restricting the spatial extent of the signal by using high-numerical-aperture optics makes high-resolution spectroscopic information accessible, facilitated with spectral-domain detection. Simultaneous acquisition of multiphoton microscopy images is used to validate tissue structure and localization of nuclei within individual cells. (c) 2006 Optical Society of America.},

   abstract = {Cell division (mitosis) is a tightly controlled process that is coordinated and regulated by a network of proteins localized in the nucleus. The key stages of mitosis are centrosome maturation, chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, centrosome separation, bipolar spindle formation, chromosome separation, and finally cytokinesis. Aurora kinase A (AKA) belongs to the Aurora kinase family of serine/threonine kinases, which have been shown toplaycriticalrolesinmitoticprogression. Duringmitosis, AKA localizes to centrosomes during late S to early G2 phase. As the cell proceeds to metaphase, AKA localizes to the microtubules and near the spindle poles, where it remains until anaphase when it migrates to some extent to the spindle midzone. Finally, during cytokinesis, AKA localizes to the midbody. Whilst localized to these specific cellular regions, AKA interacts with and phosphorylates several intracellular targets, including p53, MBD3, and BRCA1, each of which are critical mediators of malignant transformation. The unique stage-specific nuclear and intracellular locations of AKA during mitosis thus make it an interesting imaging target},
